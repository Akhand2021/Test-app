# ReactNative Login Registration using Laravel API

This repository contains a complete application that demonstrates how to implement a login and registration system in a React Native app using a Laravel API as the backend. The project consists of two parts: the Laravel API and the React Native app.

## Laravel API

### Installation

1. Clone the Laravel API repository: `git clone https://github.com/Akhand2021/Laravel-reactnative-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Laravel-reactnative-api`
3. Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
4. Set up your database in the `.env` file and run the migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Start the Laravel server: `php artisan serve`

The Laravel API will be up and running, ready to handle login and registration requests from the React Native app.

## React Native App

### Installation

1. Clone the React Native app repository: `git clone https://github.com/Akhand2021/reactnative-login-registration-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd reactnative-login-registration-app`
3. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the React Native development server: `expo start`

The React Native app will launch in the Expo development environment, where you can use an emulator or scan the QR code to test the app on your physical device.

## Usage

1. Launch the React Native app on your device or emulator.
2. You will see the login and registration screens.
3. Register a new account or log in with an existing account.
4. After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the home screen.
